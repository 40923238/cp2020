<p><em class="bold" lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Metacognitive Activities:</em></em><span><span> </span>These activities are designed to support your development as an independent learner, encouraging you to reflect on your progress and plan for continuing success. These activities include:</span></p>
<ul lang="">
<li lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">My Response activities:</em><span> </span>These short activities are located at the end of the module; they encourage you to reflect on your progress through the module and estimate how well you believe you've attained the module's learning objectives. These activities also provide a place to share continuing questions and areas of difficulty (if you're using the course in conjunction with an instructor, your questions will be shared with your instructor).</li>
<li lang=""><em class="italic" lang="">Checkpoints:</em><span> </span>These activities are located across the course after sections of content that can be particularly challenging or require additional practice. These metacognitive<span> </span><span class="term" lang="">checkpoints</span>encourage you to review your progress so far and assess yourself: are you ready to continue, or do you believe you need additional materials, practice, or self-assessment? If you feel that you're not ready to proceed, these checkpoints provide links to additional learning materials.</li>

<h1>Develop</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mdecourse/cmsimde">https://github.com/mdecourse/cmsimde</a> 的開發, 可以在一個目錄中放入 cmsimde, 然後將 up_dir 中的內容放到與 cmsimde 目錄同位階的地方, 使用 command 進入 cmsimde 目錄, 執行 python wsgi.py, 就可以啟動, 以瀏覽器 https://localhost:9443 就可以連接, 以 admin 作為管理者密碼, 就可以登入維護內容.</p>
<p>cmsimde 的開發採用 Leo Editor, 開啟 cmsimde 目錄中的 cmsimde.leo 就可以進行程式修改, 結束後, 若要保留網際內容, 只要將 cmsimde 外部的內容倒回 up_dir 目錄中即可後續對 cmsimde 遠端倉儲進行改版.</p>
<p>init.py 位於  up_dir 目錄, 可以設定 site_title 與 uwsgi 等變數.</p>
